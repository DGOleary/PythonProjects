Tired of those annoying video files taking up so much space on your hard drive?
Try this video to ascii converter that saves so much valuable space by getting rid of unnecessary 
bloat like audio, color, half of the frames, most of the resolution, and even pixels!

As an example, it was able to take an overwhelming 29 megabtye 1080p video to a much more
manageable 4.74 megabyte text file (only 2.47 with Windows compression)!
That's a file 6.5 times smaller!

Simply run the videoasciiconvert.py script, enter an .mp4 file (note: this program has only been
tested with .mp4 files) and wait for the conversion to complete, and then run the videoasciiplayer.py
script and enter your new, converted video which was output as a .txt file and sit back and relax
as it plays in your console!
